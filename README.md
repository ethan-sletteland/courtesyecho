# courtesyecho 🤫

i was at bombay airport. some dude was watching reels on full volume and laughing loudly. asking nicely doesn't work anymore. me being me, didn't have the courage to speak up.

so i built a tiny app that plays back the same audio it hears, delayed by ~2 seconds. asked claude, it spat out a working version in one prompt. surprisingly WORKS.

## the science (probably)

something something auditory feedback loop something something cognitive dissonance. idk i'm not a neuroscientist. all i know is it makes people shut up and that's good enough for me.

> straight up honest - originally called this "make-it-stop" but then saw [@TimDarcet](https://x.com/TimDarcet) also built [similar](https://tim.darcet.fr/shutthefuckup/) and named it STFU. wayyyyy better name. so stole it. sorry not sorry.
